Re: **[[Organization 2 Name]] (the “Company”)**

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

Reference is made to the Business Combination Agreement by and between the Company and [[Organization 1 Name]] dated [[Date 1: Date]] and amended on [[Date 2: Date]]. Pursuant to Section 7.1(b) of the Agreement, as amended, either party may terminate the Agreement by written notice if the closing conditions set forth in Section 6.1 have not been satisfied by the date which is 150 days after the date of the Agreement, or [[Date 3: Date]] (the “Completion Deadline”). We understand the Nayarit shareholder meeting to approve the transaction is scheduled to be held on [[Date 4: Date]] and, subject to shareholder approval at that meeting, the intent is to work together to close the amalgamation promptly thereafter. Accordingly, we agree to extend the Completion Deadline to [[Date 5: Date]].

Please acknowledge your understanding of (and agreement to, as applicable) the terms and conditions outlined above by signing a copy of this letter and returning it to the undersigned.

Very truly yours,

**[[Organization 2 Name]]**
