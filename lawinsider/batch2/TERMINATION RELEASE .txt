^^^GC China has answered and vigorously disputes the Lawsuit.

[[Organization 10 Name]] and Deltawind, on the one hand, and [[Organization 11 Name]], on the other hand, now wish to reach a full and final settlement of the Lawsuit and all other disputes among them and to terminate all agreements, arrangements, relationships and understandings among them other than as set forth in this Agreement.

The Indemnitee, and its employees and agents, will cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnitor may not enter into any settlement or compromise unless such settlement or compromise unconditionally releases the Indemnitee from all liability for all Claims or unless such settlement or compromise is consented to in writing by the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitor will not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled or compromised by the Indemnitee without the written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
