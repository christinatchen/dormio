NOTES to TABLE F-l(a) and (b): 

^Where indicated, Fidelity shall also pay [[Organization 2 Name]] the actual Security APL charges paid by [[Organization 2 Name]] for the associated accounts.

^Annual full service platform fees (all fee components from Table F-2 purchased) on a per account basis will be the greater of either the bps charge or the corresponding “per account $ charge” by Investment Product. Platform fee minimums will be adjusted pro-rata when different categories of platform services are provided. [[Organization 2 Name]] reserves the right to refuse accounts that fall below the minimums if it feels these cannot be properly administered, typically due to trade minimums.

^All performance reports are trade ready and fully reconciled daily for both performance and trading. Includes quarterly performance report (pdf) and daily on-line reporting (html). Billing administration includes billing computation, collection from the custodian, and disbursement to the broker/dealer home office or RIA. Conversion of performance or cost basis not included in this price. [[Organization 2 Name]] reserves the right to charge additional fees for large numbers of securities, excessive trading frequency, or holding large numbers of certain types of securities that require special daily pricing services arrangements (i.e. municipal or foreign bonds, collateralized debt obligations, foreign equities, etc.). Billing at these rates will be done by brokerage account range/office code, and will not on an individual account basis.

^Fidelity and [[Organization 2 Name]] recognize that certain advisors will wish to avail themselves of a la carte services such as SMA light or stand-alone performance reporting. Such advisors may also wish to open other brokerage accounts within the same client proposal but manage these brokerage accounts directly, without using the products or services available through the [[Organization 2 Name]] platform (“Self-Directed Accounts’’). Both [[Organization 2 Name]] and Fidelity have acknowledged the importance of this scenario, and in [[Organization 2 Name]]’s contract with Fidelity Brokerage Services dated [[Date 7: Date]], [[Organization 2 Name]] provides for this scenario by allowing Accounts without paying a basis point fee on Self-Directed Accounts. [[Organization 2 Name]] agrees to allow Fidelity’s advisor clients to continue using the proposal tool for the purpose of combining these Self-Directed Accounts with the accounts managed jointly between the advisor and [[Organization 2 Name]] without paying a basis point fee on the self-directed accounts. [[Organization 2 Name]] agrees to be compensated through the proposed license fee for the source code access to the [[Organization 2 Name]] Proposal tool. However for the purpose of opening Self-Directed Accounts, Fidelity will continue to pay [[Organization 2 Name]] [*** ] per quarter for administering the data needed to support this a la carte usage until IWS platform services fees exceed [***] year or upon a [[Organization 2 Name]] obtaining reduced clearing/custody fees to our mutual satisfaction, then [[Organization 2 Name]] would then waive the [*** ] per month proposal data admin fee.
