5.1.2. Should the Direct Shares be disposed of to any third parties that are not members of [[Organization 6 Name]] and SETUBAL FAMILY, then the buyer may not enter into this Agreement, and therefore the tag along right as provided for in Section 5.2 below or any other right or obligation set forth in this Agreement shall not be applicable thereto.

^^In the event that [[Organization 8 Name]] [[Organization 2 Name]] decide to directly or indirectly dispose of the total Shares or the total shares issued by [[Organization 1 Name]] and held by [[Organization 1 Name]] to any third parties, then ITAÚSA shall have the right to demand that up to the total Direct Shares be also purchase according to the same terms and conditions negotiated by [[Organization 8 Name]] by [[Organization 2 Name]] with the third party buyer.

5.2.1. In the event that ITAÚSA exercises the right discussed in Section 5.2 above, then the third party buyer may only purchase, directly or indirectly, the Shares held by ITAÚSA itself and by the members of [[Organization 2 Name]] or the shares issued by [[Organization 1 Name]] and held by [[Organization 1 Name]], as the case may be, if the third party buyer also purchases, on the same terms and conditions, the Direct Shares that ITAÚSA decides to dispose of.

5.2.2. ITAÚSA shall have the non-extendable term of thirty (30) days as of the date on which [[Organization 8 Name]] [[Organization 2 Name]] decide to directly or indirectly sell the Shares or the shares issued by [[Organization 1 Name]] and held by [[Organization 1 Name]] to voice its intention to exercise the right of disposal of Direct Shares together with the total Shares issued by [[Organization 1 Name]] or by [[Organization 1 Name]], and once said term has elapsed, ITAÚSA shall be deemed to have waived the right set forth in this Section 5.2.

^^[[Organization 8 Name]] [[Organization 2 Name]] undertake to settle, in a harmonic manner, by means of amicable negotiation, any controversy, dispute, divergence, litigation or demand (“Dispute”) which may arise between the Parties in relation to this Agreement, whether directly or indirectly, always taking into account the strict interest of [[Organization 1 Name]] and [[Organization 1 Name]], as well as the principles of mutual cooperation, loyalty, good faith and faithfulness that shall govern the relationship among the Parties.

^^Once the Arbitration Tribunal is implemented, it shall be incumbent upon it to settle all issues arising out of or related to the subject-matter of the claim, including those of an incidental, provisional or coercitive nature.

^^Notwithstanding the provisions above, each Party shall continue to be entitled to resort to the Judiciary to petition for granting of a preliminary injunction or a provisional remedy as required for the sole use by the Arbitration.

9.11.1. Any court orders granted pursuant to Section 9.11, before or after the beginning of the Arbitration, shall not be deemed to be incompatible with the provisions of Section Nine, nor shall they imply waiver of the arbitration tribunal.

9.11.2. For the purposes of this Section 9.11, the parties elect the courts of the City of São Paulo, State of São Paulo and waive any other courts, however privileged they may be.

^^In addition to the authority vested thereupon by the rules of the Chamber, the arbitration tribunal shall have the authority to request preliminary injunctions or provisional remedies whenever it may think fit and fair.

^^The arbitration award shall be handed down in writing, including the grounds therefor, and shall be finally binding upon the parties and enforceable pursuant to its terms.
