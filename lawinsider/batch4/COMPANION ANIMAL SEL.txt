^[[Organization 1 Name]] hereby appoints MWI, and MWI hereby accepts appointment, as a contract distributor for [[Organization 1 Name]]’s Products, to purchase from [[Organization 1 Name]] and to resell for MWI’s own account as a distributor, subject to the following terms and conditions.

^MWI recognizes and agrees to the following:

^^[[Organization 1 Name]] has elected to work with a select group of distributors that are committed to maximizing the sale of the Products and to working closely with [[Organization 1 Name]] to identify market opportunities for both companies. The intent of this Agreement is to attain that goal;

^Accordingly, MWI shall:

^^allow [[Organization 1 Name]]’s representatives to attend and actively participate in meetings of MWI’s sales representatives;

^^MWI agrees that credit limits established by [[Organization 1 Name]] shall be subject to change by [[Organization 1 Name]] in its sole discretion and that no shipments will be made to MWI in excess of the established credit limits.

^^take no action, whether or not identified above, that would harm the goodwill of the Products;

[[Organization 1 Name]] also shall permit MWI to participate in the distributor incentive programs offered by [[Organization 1 Name]], in accordance with the terms of such programs. [[Organization 1 Name]] shall have the unrestricted right to revise the prices, terms and conditions of the Price List, and to add or delete Products or package sizes, without advance notice to MWI, and the revisions shall be effective on all orders submitted after the effective date of the price revisions.

^^Direct purchase from [[Organization 1 Name]] will be used to determine the level of purchases achieved. Any discrepancies must be documented by the Marketing Agreement holder using copies of [[Organization 1 Name]] invoices.

^Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit [[Organization 1 Name]]’s ability to sell Products to any other party.

^All purchases by MWI pursuant to this Agreement shall be in accordance with the terms of [[Organization 1 Name]]’s Pricing and Shipping Policies, as may be amended by [[Organization 1 Name]] from time to time. Unless the parties agree otherwise, shipments shall be made to either MWI’s central warehouse point or to branch offices at MWI’s direction.

Programs that use these funds must be discussed in advance with MWI’s [[Organization 1 Name]] Account Executive, submitted in writing to [[Organization 1 Name]]’s Senior Director of Distribution and approved in writing by [[Organization 1 Name]]’s Senior Director of Distribution prior to the start of the program.

^To be eligible for CMP funds, programs must include specific performance metrics and specifics on total CMP funds to be spent in the program and how all CMP funds would be spent.

^All program wrap-ups and invoices are to be submitted within 45 days of completion of the program. Wrap ups and invoices for programs that run to year end 2009 should be submitted no later than [[Date 5: Date]] for payment.

Wrap ups and invoices for programs that run to year end 2010 should be submitted no later than [[Date 6: Date]] for payment. Programs will be paid by check or credit memo.
