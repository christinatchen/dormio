^System Functionality. 

^^Major function: A platform function that is necessary for a financial advisor or a home-office administrator to support the activities of proposal generation and account management. Examples include the ability to create an investment proposal, trade an advisor-directed model, or access core performance reports. 

^^^Minor function: Any non-major function. Work-around: An alternate approach to operating the software that does not require a significant number of additional steps. 

^Severity Levels. 

The following severity levels are used for determining patch procedures: 

Severity Level 1: 

^system failure where any major function of the platform in non-operational and there is no known work-around. A problem with this severity requires immediate attention and will be patched immediately as soon as a fix can be determined. 

\centered **Confidential Treatment Requested** 

Severity Level 2: 

^system failure that results in a) a major function of the platform to no longer operate as designed but a “work-around” exists, b) a minor function of the platform to no longer operate as designed and no “work-around” exists, or c) a significant degradation in performance. A problem of this severity requires prompt attention (within two hours of discovery), and will be patched after normal business hours as soon as a fix is determined. 

Severity Level 3: 

^system failure that results in a) a minor function of the platform to no longer operate as designed and a “work-around” exists, b) slightly degraded performance, c) the display of incomplete results, or d) the display of inaccurate but not potentially damaging results. A problem of this severity will be corrected in the next regularly scheduled release. In some cases, a problem of this severity will be patched after normal business hours if a fix is determined that can be safely applied with no risk to any other function, and the fix is explicitly requested by a customer. An example of this would be the change to the text in an HTML document, or the correction of a data element that is specific to a particular advisor or firm. 

Severity Level 4: 

All other system failures; for example, platform operation inconsistent with technical documentation, misspelled words, minor navigational errors, or minor graphical or display errors.
